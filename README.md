# Cookbook: Computer Vision for Non-Stem Majors, All You Ever Wanted To Know 

by Michael Valentino Ochoa

## THE REASONS FOR THIS COOKBOOK

* This document was written for non-stem learners interested in computer vision.  The goal is provide readers with a working understanding of computer vision. I presume you have high school / early college math literacy. I also assume a knowledge of programming, as examples are coded in C/C++.  
* This cookbook is filled with code for low level computer vision applications. I organize the document around dialing up the complexity bit by bit to show code in action. All problems are broken down into smaller digestable components, and then put together in a way yielding fresh tools and insights. For the sake of this document we avoid three dimensional vision, and largely avoid RGB color maps.  My hope is to show curious non-stem students how to identify and classify objects into themed groups.
