# Cookbook: Computer Vision for Non-Stem Majors, All You Ever Wanted To Know 

by Michael Valentino Ochoa

## REASONS FOR THIS COOKBOOK

* This document was written for non-stem learners interested in computer vision.  The goal is to provide readers with a working understanding of computer vision. I presume you have high school and early college math literacy. I also assume a knowledge of programming, as examples are coded in C++.  
* This cookbook is filled with code for computer vision applications. I organize the document around dialing up the complexity bit by bit to show code in action. All problems are broken down into smaller digestable components, and then put together in a way yielding fresh tools and insights. The few who understand computer vision technology and have the skills to rapidly deploy technology with C++ have a huge advantage.  The goal of this document is to assist non-stem learners in scooping up this valuable advantage.
