# computer vision for non-stem majors: all you ever wanted to know 
## by michael valentino ochoa

" If you think like a computer, writing C actually makes sense "

* This document was written for non-stem university student interested in computer vision.  This document provides readers with a practical working understanding of computer vision. I presume you have high school and early college math literacy. I assume a knowledge of C and programming, as examples are coded in C.  
* This document contains code for low level computer vision applications that compile on a Nvidia Jetson Xavier XN. I organize the document around an increasing complexity to demonstarate code in action. For the time being I avoid three dimensional vision, and largely avoid RBG color maps.  The goal is to show interested non-stem university students the essentials ideas of computer vision applications. Real world example applications are drawn from corner store and reminiscene therapy scenes. My hope is that readng this is a jumping off point for ones own questions.
