# CV Cookbook: Computer Vision for Non-Stem Students, All You Ever Wanted To Know 

by Michael Valentino Ochoa

## REASONS FOR THIS COOKBOOK

* This document was written for non-stem students interested in computer vision, a term used to describe methods that give hand-held size processors the power of understanding a scene.  The goal is to provide readers with a working understanding and much more.  
* Moving forward, I presume readers have high school and early college math literacy. The hope is you can gain a working understanding of computer vision thru code/pseudocode/diagrams, with examples coded in C++. The document below will dial up the complexity bit by bit to show it all in action. The goal is to help non-stem students scoop up a working understanding of computer vision.

## INTRODUCTION

## "DEVELOPMENT CYCLE"

1 - We observe the subleties of the problems we are trying to solve. We are not trying to solve the wrong computer vision problems.

2 - We write psuedocode/flowcharts and check the logic with friends

3 - We translate 2 into code for IDE

4 - Complier does its thing

5 - Run it!

6 - We test, then debug program under many scenarios
